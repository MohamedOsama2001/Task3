# My Advanced Blog Project

This is an advanced blog project that utilizes HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript to create a responsive and modern web page. The project includes a header with a navigation bar, a main content area with articles, a sidebar, and a footer with a contact form.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the structure of the page.
- `styles.css`: The external CSS file that contains styles for the page, including custom variables for easy maintenance.
- `scripts.js`: The JavaScript file that includes functionality like the "Back to Top" button.
- `README.md`: This file, which explains the project structure and how to run it.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes Bootstrap's grid system for a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Semantic HTML**: The page structure is built using semantic elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` for better accessibility and SEO.
- **Back to Top Button**: A button that appears when the user scrolls down and takes them back to the top of the page when clicked.
- **Contact Form**: A simple contact form in the footer section.
- **Optimized Performance**: CSS is loaded in a non-blocking manner, and images and scripts are optimized for faster page loading.
